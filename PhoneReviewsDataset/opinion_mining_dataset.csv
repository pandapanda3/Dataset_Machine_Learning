I can play games and it will genuinely last for a long time (ofc will vary from people and types of games and apps they use). The fingerprint scanner is instant! Like no lag when using it. The face rec is decent too, I prefer the fingerprint but I use both and they are both good. The phone looks sexy as hell too. But it's a fingerprint magnet, so buy a clear case in addition since UK models don't get cases. And oo charges really fast too.","Product, Part",Positive|

The face rec is decent too, I prefer the fingerprint but I use both and they both good. The phone looks sexy as hell too.

"| Phone speed - amazing. Phone features - amazing. Phone design and colour - amazing. Memory on phone - amazing. Battery life and how quickly it charges - amazing. Fingerprint scanner - amazing. In fact amazing is just an understatement. I have always loved Huawei phones since getting my first one back in Spring 2017. I will try to hold out with Huawei for as long as possible (even if it means to continuously buy pre-May 2019 phones). Literally, what more can I say? I have had this phone for 6 months and it is still going strong. I am so happy with my purchase :)","Product, Part     ",Positive|

"| This phone IS AWEEESOME FOR THE PRICE. I got the peacock blue p30 lite for £180. The phone has great battery life. I can play games and it will genuinely last for a long time (ofc will vary from people and types of games and apps they use). The fingerprint scanner is instant! Like no lag when using it. The face rec is decent too, I prefer the fingerprint but I use both and they both good. The phone looks sexy as hell too. But its a fingerprint magnet, so buy a clear case in addition since UK models don't get cases. And oo charges really fast too.","Product, Part     ",Positive|
